# Bikini Bottom Wars Game

Based on the [Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game](https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Play-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock/), the player chooses to play against a SpongeBob show character.

The first modal that is shown to the player is that they choose their name and start to play. If they do not choose one, an alert will be displayed to indicate that they will simply be called 'Player' in the game.
